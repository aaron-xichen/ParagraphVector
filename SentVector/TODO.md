TODO List

- How to initialize inputs? (Solved, may not be optimal)
- Split the training data into two parts: training data and validation data.
- When to stop updating? (Solved --- fixed number of iterations, may not be optimal)
- AdaSGD updating (Solved, need double check)
- Prediction
- L1 and L2 regularization on parameters
